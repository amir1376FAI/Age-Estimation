![Age Estimation Model](https://tokenoftrust.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image_hero_age-estimation_612x583.webp)


## **üß† Project Overview**

Age estimation is a challenging and interesting task in computer vision. Factors such as lifestyle, genetics, ethnicity, makeup, and imaging conditions make accurate age prediction difficult. 
In this project, we perform **age estimation from face images** using **deep learning techniques**, leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks to predict a person‚Äôs age based on facial features.

## **üåü Features**

- Develops a **precise method for age estimation from face images**  
- Supports **real-time usage**  
- **Robust to challenges** such as poor lighting and imaging conditions  
- **Robust to variations** such as gender and ethnicity

## **üõ†Ô∏è Project Steps**

1. **Data**  
2. **Model**  
3. **Model Configuration** (Loss functions, Metrics, Optimizers, etc.)  
4. **Training and Validation Functions**  
5. **Model Training** ‚Äì this is where practical experience plays a key role!  
6. **Evaluation**  

## üìÇ Data

This project uses the **[UTKFace dataset](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/)**, a large-scale face dataset with a wide age range (0 to 116 years old). The dataset contains over **20,000 face images** with annotations for **age, gender, and ethnicity**.  

The images include a large variation in:
- Pose  
- Facial expression  
- Illumination  
- Occlusion  
- Resolution  

This dataset can be used for a variety of tasks, including:
- Face detection  
- Age estimation  
- Age progression/regression  
- Landmark localization  


## **üìâüìàEDA**

Let's explore the images in the UTK dataset together!:

üîç Interesting Observations in the Dataset:

- The dataset contains **only the face region**  
- The dataset is **aligned**  
- All images in the dataset are **200x200 pixels** (some images have been upscaled, which may reduce quality)  
- The images are **in color**  
- Some faces are **angled**, which makes the task more challenging  
- Some images contain **only a part of the face** (e.g., only the eyes)  
- There are **multiple images of the same person**, which can challenge the evaluation  
- Some **labels may be incorrect**  
- Some images contain **watermarks**  
- There is **high variation in lighting**, which can challenge the network  
- Some faces are actually **paintings** but have been labeled as real

**Age Histogram:**

The age distribution in the dataset is **right-skewed**, with younger ages (0‚Äì30 years) dominating and older ages (>50 years) underrepresented (mean age = 32.0, median = 29.0). The highest frequency occurs in the youngest age bin (~3,500 samples), and counts gradually decline for middle and older age groups, creating a **severe class imbalance**. This bias may cause the model to perform better on younger faces while struggling with older adults. To address these challenges, techniques such as **oversampling rare age groups, weighted loss during training, data augmentation**, or collecting more data for older ages can be considered to improve model performance across all age ranges.

**Plot histogram for gender:**

The dataset shows a **balanced gender distribution**, with approximately **10,957 male** and **10,957 female** samples out of 21,914 labeled images. However, **1,251 samples (5.4%) are missing gender labels**, which may indicate unlabeled data or potential errors. Overall, male and female faces are nearly equally represented, minimizing class imbalance for gender. To ensure robust model training, the missing labels should be investigated, as they could introduce noise or bias if ignored, especially when handling faces with ambiguous gender traits.

**Plot histogram for ethnicity:**

<img width="975" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b2b4170-8c45-4229-b053-041998b8261b" />

The dataset shows a **class imbalance** among ethnicities:  
- White: 9,698 samples (42%)  
- Black: 4,478 samples  
- Indian: 3,952 samples  
- Asian: 3,348 samples  
- Others: 1,689 samples  

White and Indian groups are the most represented, while the "Others" category has the fewest samples, which may lead to **poorer model performance** for underrepresented groups. This imbalance introduces a **bias risk**, as the model may overfit to dominant groups and perform less accurately on minority ethnicities.

## üßπ Data Preparation and Preprocessing

- **Fixing basic issues in the dataset**  
  - For example, removing or correcting unlabeled, corrupted, or problematic data  

- **Splitting the dataset into train, test, and validation sets**  
  - In this project, **30% of the dataset** was allocated for evaluation and testing, with **half of this portion used for testing** and the other half for validation

## üîÑ Data Augmentation and Normalization

- **Data Augmentation**  
  Using torchvision transforms, we applied the following augmentations **only to the training data**:
  - Resizing images to **128x128 pixels**  
  - Applying **random horizontal flips**  
  - Introducing **random rotations** of 15 degrees  
  - Adjusting image color using **ColorJitter**  
  - Converting images to **tensors**  
  - Normalizing pixel values using the provided mean and standard deviation:  
    `mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`  

- **Data Normalization and Standardization**  
  Ensures that all images have a consistent scale and distribution for better model training.

## üí° Model

For this project, we use **ResNet50**, a widely-used convolutional neural network (CNN) known for its high performance in image recognition tasks. ResNet, short for **Residual Network**, introduces the concept of **residual learning**, which helps train very deep networks effectively by addressing the **vanishing gradient problem**.

### Key Features of ResNet50:
- **50 layers deep** including convolutional, batch normalization, and identity shortcut layers  
- **Residual blocks** allow the network to learn **identity mappings**, making it easier for the network to learn deeper representations  
- Pretrained versions (on ImageNet) can be fine-tuned for **transfer learning**, which accelerates training and improves performance on smaller datasets  

### Why ResNet50 for Age Estimation:
- Effectively captures **facial features** at multiple levels of abstraction  
- Handles **complex variations** in pose, lighting, and expression  
- Provides a strong backbone for regression tasks such as predicting **continuous age values**  

By leveraging ResNet50, our model can extract robust features from face images and provide accurate age estimation across a wide range of inputs.
